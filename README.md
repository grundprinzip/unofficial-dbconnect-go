# Unofficial unsupported experimental Databricks Connect Go Client

This is the unsupported unofficial experimental Databricks Connect Go client. 
It is based on the Python client and is not officially supported and affilieated with and
by Databricks.

It works similar to the Python version in that it allows you to connect to Databricks
by connecting to a cluster or the serverless compute.
